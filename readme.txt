<p><strong>Here's what Embed Image Technology does:</strong>
</br><strong>1) </strong>Your images will be embeddable with just a click, offering a simpler and approved alternative to people saving & reposting images w/o permission
</br><strong>2) </strong>Every embedded image will contain a link back pointing to your website - Building SEO and driving traffic
</br><strong>3) </strong>Every embedded image will contain an ad space so you can monetize it on the embedding website, or use it as a promotional and traffic driving tool.
</br><strong>4) </strong>Embedded images will be clickable pointing back at the URL where the image originated - Increasing traffic, additional embeds, etc.
</br><strong>5) </strong>You'll have access to reporting and be able to track where your images are appearing across the web
</br><strong>6) </strong>You'll have the ability to remove unwanted image embeds with just a click</p>

<p><strong>Reporting:</strong>
Embed Image let's you see what websites are embedding which images, and how many impressions those images are receiving. You'll also have the ability to remove unwanted embeds with just a click.</p>

<p><strong>Ad Revenue:</strong>
Embed Image gives you access to 50% of the ad impressions for free. You can display your ad network of choice, or feel free to use the ad space as a promotional tool for your own website. You can display a promotion for: upcoming events, breaking news, premium content, coupon codes, etc. And since Embed Image uses an inventory share of the ad impressions, if you chose to display ad code from an ad network you get paid directly from them and never have to wait for a check from us!</p>

<p><strong>GET CLEVER: </strong>
